# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by gathering and understanding user requirements and experiencing then translating that into functional software components. User stories act as a conduit between the users’ needs and the technical implementation. It encapsulates a specific requirement from the user’s perspective. This allows the project to be value-driven rather than driven by technical achievements.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I prefer to embrace adaptability when developing programs with a focus on user-centric design and continuous improvement. In the future I intend to use Scrum and Kanban as my agile methodologies in future projects, depending on the project size and complexity.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
This goes beyond being technically skilled, and touches on being collaborative, innovative, positive, and open in your approach to work. It means actively contributing to a team’s objectives not only with code with also with effective communication, knowledge sharing, and support (both work-related and moral). Good team members not only demonstrate having good programming skills, but also demonstrate a reliability in meeting deadlines, maintaining high quality standards in their work, being available to listen attentively to teammates, respect diverse perspectives, and allows themselves to be open to feedback and criticism. A good teammate not only contributes in a technical manner, but also in a positive human way.
